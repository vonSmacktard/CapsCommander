CapsCommander by Baron von Smacktard (um, 5 Sep 2023)

This program checks every half second whether or not the CapsLock is on or not.

If it's on, this program turns it off.
If it's off, this program fucks off and does nothing.

Right Click CL trayicon to exit program
Double Left Click CL trayicon to toggle whether or not the program
	gives a fuck about the capslock key state.


Source code is shittily documented, do with this as you like.
